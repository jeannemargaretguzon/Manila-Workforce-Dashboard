In the pursuit of sustainable economic growth and development, the role of education and industry alignment cannot be overstated. By employing data-driven insights, this study tackles the need to bridge the gap between education and employment demands. The goal is to address the issue of particular courses being underrepresented in the local educational scene, which has a negative impact on the availability of trained employees for vital industries. The motivation for this study stems from observation that some courses may be neglected, potentially leading to a mismatch between the demands of critical businesses and the skills available in the workforce.
